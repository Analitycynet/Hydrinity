# Hydrinity ![CI](https://github.com/Hydrinity/Hydrinity/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
A Tuinity fork with experimental performance patches and improvements. Hydrinity also ports patches from certain performance mods, such as [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium), and other Paper forks.

Hydrinity a fork for my own server, intended to help solve certain performance bottlenecks, and as such, I tend to test all changes in production. That being said, there is no *guarantee* of stability. Try it out at your own risk.

### Building
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./hydrinity jar
```
